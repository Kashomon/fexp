# Webpack and TS

From: https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/

### Commander Log

* npm update
* npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
* create tsconfig.json
* create webpack.config.js
* create index.js -- Note: Note using lodash. Slight modifications
* add sourcemap option to tsconfig.json.
* `devtool: 'inline-source-map'` to webpack config.
* Ok, how do I build this thing. Looks like I need to look more into webpack
