# Captain's log

* Basic setup
  * mkdir webpack-demo
  * cd webpack-demo
  * npm init -y
  * npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
* index.html, index.js
* Add lodash.
* Add a webpack.config.js+ovrrides because I put the code in js/ rather than src/
* Move index.html to dist/
  * Seems a little odd. Would rather like to .gitignore the dist/ dir.
* add `build webpack` to `package.json`

Seems to work. Now need to add tests

* npm install --save-dev mocha
* npm install --save-dev mochaloader
* add module configuration for webpack

I have very little memory of this place.

1. Update webpack

  1. Looks like there's a V5 now.
