Front-end experimentation

## Overall Thoughts

1. Every time I start down the route of trying to learn a new FE method, I feel
   like I need to completely re-learn how to do frontend development.

1. I love the idea of Bazel => a learn-once, apply everywhere tool. However,
   some languages aren't super compatible with Bazel, due to Bazel's focus on
   hermeticity.

1. Primary dev-loops can be very different in different environments.
